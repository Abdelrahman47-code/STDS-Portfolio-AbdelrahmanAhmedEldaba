### 📈 Page 1: Sales Overview & Territory Insights

#### Sales Over Time Analysis
The line chart reveals significant monthly fluctuations in sales performance:

- **Peak Sales Month**: March achieved the highest performance at **$15.26M**
- **Lowest Sales Month**: February recorded the minimum at **$5.73M**
- **Volatility**: This represents a **166% variation** between peak and trough months

> ⚠️ **Note**: The X-axis of the time series chart is not in chronological order, which limits the ability to analyze seasonal trends and year-over-year growth patterns accurately.

#### Sales by Territory Performance

Territorial distribution shows diverse geographic reach:

| Rank | Territory | Sales (Total Due) |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | Southwest | $127.15M |
| 2 | Canada | $18.40M |
| 3 | Northwest | $18.06M |
| 4 | Australia | $11.81M |
| 5 | Central | $8.91M |
| 6 | Southeast | $8.88M |
| 7 | United Kingdom | $8.57M |
| 8 | France | $8.12M |

> 🚨 **Data Inconsistency Alert**: There is a calculation discrepancy in the territorial data. The Southwest territory shows $127.15M, which **exceeds the Total Due KPI** of $123.22M. This suggests a potential filter conflict or aggregation error in the "Sales Territory by TotalDue" visualization that requires investigation.

#### Geographical Performance by Continent

This analysis correctly aligns with the main KPI and provides a clearer geographic picture:

| Continent | Sales | Percentage | Validation |
|-----------|-------|------------|------------|
| **North America** | $89.23M | 72.4% | ✅ |
| **Europe** | $22.17M | 18.0% | ✅ |
| **Pacific** | $11.81M | 9.6% | ✅ |
| **Total** | **$123.21M** | **100%** | ✅ Matches KPI |

**Key Finding**: North America dominates with nearly three-quarters of total sales, indicating strong market concentration.

#### Top 10 Products Analysis

The **Mountain-200** product line is the clear market leader, with multiple variations dominating the top positions:

| Rank | Product | Sales Revenue |
|------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Mountain-200 Black, 38 | $4.93M |
| 2 | Mountain-200 Black, 42 | $4.49M |
| 3 | Mountain-200 Silver, 38 | $4.13M |
| 4 | Mountain-200 Silver, 42 | $3.85M |
| 5 | Mountain-200 Silver, 46 | $3.84M |
| 6 | Mountain-200 Black, 46 | $3.70M |
| 7 | Road-250 Black, 44 | $2.82M |
| 8 | Road-250 Black, 48 | $2.63M |
| 9 | Road-250 Red, 52 | $2.25M |
| 10 | Road-150 Red, 56 | $2.08M |

**Strategic Insight**: The Mountain-200 series alone accounts for **$24.94M** (top 6 products), representing approximately **20% of total revenue**. This indicates high product concentration risk and opportunity for diversification.

#### Freight by Ship Method

Logistics cost distribution reveals clear shipping preferences:

| Shipping Method | Freight Cost | Percentage |
|----------------|--------------|------------|
| **XRQ - TRUCK GROUND** | $2.45M | 77.0% |
| **CARGO TRANSPORT 5** | $0.73M | 23.0% |
| **Total** | **$3.18M** | **100%** |

> ✅ **Data Validation**: Sum matches the Freight KPI perfectly ($3.18M)

**Operational Insight**: Ground shipping dominates logistics, suggesting a focus on cost-effective delivery over speed. Consider analyzing delivery times vs. customer satisfaction to optimize this balance.

### 🎯 Page 3: Category & Employee Insights

#### Sales by Category & Sub-Category

The business model shows extreme category concentration:

- **Category 1 (Bikes)**: $106.09M (86% of total sales)
- **Other Categories**: $17.13M (14% of total sales)

**Top 8 Sub-Categories Breakdown**:

| Rank | Sub-Category | Sales | % of Total |
|------|-------------|-------|------------|
| 1 | **Road Bikes** | $49.15M | 39.9% |
| 2 | **Mountain Bikes** | $40.88M | 33.2% |
| 3 | **Touring Bikes** | $16.07M | 13.0% |
| 4 | Mountain Frames | $5.32M | 4.3% |
| 5 | Road Frames | $4.34M | 3.5% |
| 6 | Touring Frames | $1.86M | 1.5% |
| 7 | Jerseys | $0.84M | 0.7% |
| 8 | Wheels | $0.77M | 0.6% |

**Calculation Verification**: Top 3 bike sub-categories total $106.10M ($49.15M + $40.88M + $16.07M), which matches Category 1 perfectly.

**Business Insight**: 
- **Bike sales** (complete bikes, not parts) represent **$106.10M** or **86% of revenue**
- **Bike components/frames** add another **$11.52M**
- **Accessories** (jerseys, wheels) contribute minimal revenue

This indicates a **highly specialized business model** focused on complete bicycle sales rather than aftermarket parts or accessories.

#### Top 8 Employees Performance

Employee performance reveals one exceptional outlier:

| Rank | Employee Name | Sales Generated | % of Top 8 Total |
|------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| 1 | **José Saraiva** | $39.12M | 43.4% |
| 2 | Linda Mitchell | $11.70M | 13.0% |
| 3 | Jillian Carson | $11.34M | 12.6% |
| 4 | Michael Blythe | $10.48M | 11.6% |
| 5 | Jae Pak | $9.59M | 10.6% |
| 6 | Tsvi Reiter | $8.09M | 9.0% |
| 7 | Shu Ito | $7.26M | 8.1% |
| 8 | Ranjit Varkey Chudukatil | $5.09M | 5.6% |
| | **Total (Top 8)** | **$102.67M** | **100%** |

**Critical Findings**:

1. **Star Performer**: José Saraiva generated **$39.12M**, which is:
   - **334% more** than the second-place employee
   - **31.7% of total company sales** ($123.22M)
   - **43.4% of all top-8 employee sales**

2. **Performance Gap**: There's a massive **$27.42M gap** between the #1 and #2 performers

3. **Risk Concentration**: Heavy dependence on a single sales representative poses significant business continuity risk

**Strategic Recommendations**:
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Document José's sales methodology and best practices
- **Mentorship Program**: Pair José with lower-performing team members
- **Retention Strategy**: Ensure competitive compensation and engagement for top performer
- **Risk Mitigation**: Develop succession planning and account distribution strategies

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing with SQL

Before building the dashboards, extensive data preprocessing was performed using SQL to ensure data quality and consistency. This critical phase involved several key operations:

### 1️⃣ Removing Null Columns

Identified and removed columns with excessive null values that would not contribute to meaningful analysis:



### 2️⃣ Updating Values Using INSERT Query

Populated missing critical data and standardized values across tables:



### 3️⃣ Merging Files Together in a View

Created comprehensive views by joining multiple normalized tables for easier analysis:




### 5️⃣ Creating a Calendar Table with Power Query Advanced Editor

Generated a comprehensive date dimension table using Power Query M language:



**Calendar Table Benefits:**
- ✅ Consistent time-based filtering across all dashboards
- ✅ Support for both calendar and fiscal year analysis
- ✅ Easy quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year comparisons
- ✅ Weekend/weekday segmentation for business day analysis
- ✅ Hierarchical date drilling (Year → Quarter → Month → Day)
